Number of Occurences
Let's start practicing searching with a simple problem statement. You are given an unsorted array of characters 
A
 and a character x. You have to find the number of times x occurs in character array 
A
.

Input format
First line contains an integer 
T
, number of test cases. Then follows 
T
 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. 
First line contains 
N
, length of the array.
Second lines contains 
N
 space separated characters.

Output format
Print 
T
 lines, each containing count of occurences of x in character array 
A
.
