Initialize a global length variable to -Infinity
Iterate through the inner subarrays and find the largest number using comparision.
Reset the length variable for each subarray.

Time: O(n) because the number of subarrays are limited to 4 therefore it is constant time for the outer loop, For the inner loop its O(n)
